                    <p>Connect with friends, family, and community. Quality relationships are one of the strongest predictors of happiness.</p>

                    <h3>Practice Gratitude</h3>
                    <p>Take time each day to appreciate what you have. Gratitude shifts your focus from what's missing to what's present.</p>

                    <h3>Engage in Meaningful Activities</h3>
                    <p>Pursue work and hobbies that align with your values and bring you a sense of purpose.</p>

                    <p>Exercise regularly, eat well, and get enough sleep. Physical health and mental well-being are deeply connected.</p>

                    <h3>Be Present</h3>
                    <p>Practice mindfulness and live in the moment. Much of our unhappiness comes from dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.</p>
